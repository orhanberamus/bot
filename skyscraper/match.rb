lyrics = "I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub and I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Dazed and kinda lonely

[Chorus]
You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe
I fall back down
I gotta stay high, all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh"
